#+TITLE: Sensor simulator ray-tracer

A spectral path tracer (Monte Carlo integration, physically based,
multiple importance sampling) that can simulate both vision and LIDAR,
implemented in the GPGPU purely functional array programming language
[[https://futhark-lang.org/][Futhark]].

* Dependencies
  Regardless of platform, you need to install both [[https://futhark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html][Futhark]] and [[https://rustup.rs/][Rust]]
  (and a C compiler). Futhatk is used for the main implementation, and
  all code that runs on the GPU, while Rust and C are used for some
  host-side code, like loading object files and showing an SDL2
  window.

** SDL2
   On Linux, statically compiled SDL2 is included in [[./deps/SDL2/]].

   On Windows you'll have to install SDL2 yourself. Using MSYS2
   (mingw) is recommended (yay pacman!). You may have to update your
   environment variables so that the linker can find the installed
   libraries.

** OpenCL
   You'll need both the libraries and headers for compilation, and
   drivers with support at runtime.

   On Linux, simply install the appropriate package (something like
   "opencl-dev") to get the development library. Depending on your
   distribution and hardware, your drivers may be OpenCL ready out of
   the box. Otherwise you must install packages that provide an OpenCL
   runtime (and an ICD loader?).

   On Windows, get an OpenCL SDK (preferably a "light" version) from
   your GPU vendor -- for AMD, [[https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/OCL-SDK/releases][you can find it here]]. With regards to
   runtime, you should be good to go as long as you've installed the
   normal GPU drivers for your system.

* Build
  Simply run ~make~. If it doesn't work, try poking around in the
  Makefile. You may need to change ~CC=clang~ to ~CC=gcc~ for example.

* Run
  On Linux, run with ~./main~. On Windows, use just ~main.exe~ instead.

** Controls
   For the interactive demo:

   - w, a, s, d, x, z :: Translation.
   - Arrow keys :: Rotation.
   - 1, 2 :: Increase / decrease resolution.
   - q, e :: Decrease / increase samples per (virtual) pixel.
   - SPACE :: Toggle accumulation.
   - n, m :: Disable / enable accumulation.
   - i, k :: Increase / decrease aperture size.
   - o, l :: Increase / decrease focal distance.
   - t :: Toggle LIDAR sensor.
   - 8, 9, 0 :: Self-transmitter: flash / scanning / none.
