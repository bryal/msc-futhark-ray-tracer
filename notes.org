* Sampling normal distribution

  Use *inverse transform sampling*. PBR 14.1.1 shows example for beckmann.

  1. Get the closed form expression of the CDF of the PDF.
     (CDF => integral => area under curve => we want to sample points in the area)

  2. Solve CDF for x (or θ, since sin(θ) = x).

  2.1. Note that this is the same thing as the quantile function?

  2.9. ???

  3. profit

  The quantile function of the normal distribution has a name of it's
  own, and is called the *probit*.

  CDF inverse function = quantile function.

  Futhark has a statistics library with CDF inverse function for normal distribution.
